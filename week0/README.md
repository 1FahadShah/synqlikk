# Week 0 – Scratch
# 🐻 Feed the Bear

A heart-led little game that feels like taking care of a living thing.

Built for [CS50 Week 0 - Scratch Project](https://cs50.harvard.edu), this is not just a game — it’s an emotional experience.  
You’re not chasing scores. You’re **learning to care.**



## 🎮 What’s It About?

You control this cute, hungry bear — walking left and right as food falls from the sky.

Your job? **Feed it right.**  
Not too much. Not too little. Just enough to make it happy and full.

Sounds simple? It’s not.



## 🍏🍔☠️ Food Drama

There are 3 types of food that randomly drop from above:

- **Healthy food** (like apples) → bear smiles and grows happier.
- **Junk food** (like burgers) → bear gets grumpy, mood shifts.
- **Poison** (yes, literal poison) → dangerous. May cause sadness… or worse.

Every choice you make matters.  
Every bite changes how the bear **feels**, not just how full it is.

A tiny **emotion bear** appears in the corner showing its mood — happy, angry, or sad.  
Even the **background** shifts with the emotion.



## 🧠 The Pressure Is REAL

You can't just feed anything anytime.

- Feed too much? ❌ Game over — bear overfed.
- Ignore it too long? ❌ Game over — bear starves.
- Feed poison? ❌ Game over — bear dies painfully.

This is a balance game —  
Observe, understand, and **respond with care**.



## 🐻💬 Bear Speaks

The bear actually talks to you:
“Healthy! I'm Happy :)”
“JUNK!! I'm Angry >:(”
“No one loves me :(”
“Why you killed me!!” 


And if you *nail it* —
“You Fed Me Well! 🐻✨”



That line hits harder than most games.



## 💀 Win or Die

You either:

✅ **Win** by feeding just right  
→ The bear smiles, background sparkles, and you feel like a legend.

❌ **Lose** by feeding too much, too little, or the wrong food  
→ Bear falls, says something sad, everything fades to black.

Either way — you *feel* it.



## 🔁 Play Again?

Yup.

After win or loss, you see a **Retry** button.  
Click it, the bear returns.  
And you whisper: *“This time, I got you bro.”*



## 🎵 Music + Mood
